# pythonFilters
These are data filters created with Python. Both files have similar functionality, both are data filters where I filtered people who are Python developers, or Platzi workers,
or adult (+18) workers, or old (+60) workers. The file filter_data uses high order functions, and the file data_filter uses list comprehension to work.
